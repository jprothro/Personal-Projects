# Personal-Projects
Projects done either in research or courses that have been created by myself. This currently has programs that can read .gro files 
and determine the coordinates and f4 order parameters of a trajectory of atoms. It also includes a slot machine that I made that
allows you to choose the premium symbols and reflects actual slot machine lines and calculations, including wild symbols.
